# The Sinister Joshua Project  
---  
  
### About this study  
Organised religion is a powerful force in our lives and affects us in more ways than we can imagine. This project focuses on Joshua Project which is described as an organization seeking to highlight the ethnic groups of the world with the least followers of evangelical Christianity. The project is a highly pervasive and organised association of Christian proselytizing organisations with centres across the world.  
  
One of the good things about the project - fortunately or unfortunately - is the highly detailed data they have collected on the peoples of each country. On its website, [Joshua Project](www.joshuaproject.net) propagates the idea behind its conception - "Bringing definition to the unfinished task" by providing targeted actions points for the possible conversion of each of the identified target groups.  
  
Joshua Project is a strongly funded organisation and it would be worthwhile to explore its networks, mission and actual activities. The reader is suggested to feel free to download the resources shared in this repository and contribute to the project.
